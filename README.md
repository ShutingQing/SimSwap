# SimSwap

Repository to describe, develop, document and test the SimSwap API family

## Scope

* Service APIs for “SimSwap” (see APIBacklog.md)  
* It provides the customer with the ability to:
  * Obtain information on the activation date of a SIM card on the mobile network in real time.
  * NOTE: The scope of this API family should be limited (at least at a first stage) to 4G and 5G.
* Scenario:
  * It reveals if an individual mobile phone number (MSISDN) has been ported to another SIM card, which is useful to prevent fraud by reducing the risk of account takeover fraud by strengthening SIM based authentication processes such as SMS One-time passwords. Fraudsters are using Simswap techniques to intercept SMS messages and reset passwords or receive verification codes that allow them to access protected accounts.
* Describe, develop, document and test the APIs (with 1-2 Telcos)  
* Started: October 2022
* Location: virtually
